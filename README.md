# Project Details:
## Lending Club Case Study
> This case study is regarding organizations which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.

## Objective
> If one is able to identify risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.<br>
> In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## Project Information
> To achieve our objective we have to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the given data to derive Insights which can help us in the analysis.<br>
> Before doing EDA we had to make sure that data we dealing with is clean and prepared for analysis, for that we had to clean the data which
includes removing relevant values and removing any non-relevant or gabage values.<br>
> In EDA we had to perform analysis like Univariate, Bivariate, Segmented Univariate and Multivariate Analysis.<br>
> If you are reading this, feel free to go through the jupyter notebook to have a look at the analysis done.
